  "summary": "Implemented ARM CLI MVP (local-only) with Typer commands status/validate/plan/release/rollback. Added git subprocess adapter for tags/log/diff and dirty-tree checks, Conventional Commits parser+validator, SemVer bump calculation, Markdown changelog generation (prepend), zip packager (stdlib zipfile), transaction log writer (.arm/last_release.json), and rollback executor. Added unit tests and a dry-run integration test that asserts zero side effects.",

  "risks": [
    "Rollback safety depends on correct transaction log contents; further integration tests recommended for tag deletion and revert behavior.",
